/// server can put there without two of them sharing a slot.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The altar's script (<c>NpcFunAltar.lua</c>) reuses its number space on every
/// page, so a click only means something together with the page it was made on.
/// The client sends both: <c>+12</c> is the entry whose page the click answers,
/// <c>+16</c> is the entry clicked and is -1 for a click made on the page itself
/// (measured 2026-09-22: page one's <c>1</c> arrives as <c>+12 = 1, +16 = -1</c>,
/// while the building <c>6</c> on the page <c>1</c> opened arrives as
/// <c>+12 = 1, +16 = 6</c>). Reading only <c>+12</c> therefore takes a page-one
/// click for a building and skips the whole second level - which is what the first
/// version did.
///
/// <b>Only two actions travel per page, and never the two that share a
/// coordinate.</b> The script pins new (<c>1</c>) and upgrade (<c>2</c>) to the
/// same spot and leaves delete (<c>3</c>) without one, so it inherits a slot from
/// the window's own layout. Sending all three draws them on top of each other
/// (measured: "the delete, new and upgrade buttons overlap"), and spacing them from
/// the client side does not work either: the coordinates that win are the shared
/// window layout's, not the altar script's (measured: with the altar script's two
/// position lines changed, the overlap stayed). So the page carries exactly one of
/// {new, upgrade} - chosen from whether the guild already has the building -
/// together with delete.
///
/// The numbers whose menus change accounts the server does not run yet - 4/5/6
/// (the three donation kinds) and 10 (worship) - are not published, so no state is
/// invented for them.
