/// Rewrites an NPC with the placement a reference capture recorded for it.

/// <remarks>
/// Sparta's city and newbie maps were published from the capture, so their NPCs
/// already carry the reference's own object id, appearance word, position and
/// facing. Every other map was written from the client's ini, and the difference
/// is visible in the frames the client receives: on Athens city the appearance
/// word is 0x11 where the reference sent 0x111, and the ids are shifted - the
/// npc at (75.9, -78.8) is the capture's 5212 with script key Athens_074 while
/// our row calls the same template 5213. The client resolves an NPC's dialog from
/// that identity, which is why clicking one of ours sends nothing at all.
/// <para>
/// The maps whose frames already come from the capture are excluded, so a frame
/// that is known to work is never rewritten. Everything the capture recorded is
/// applied together: id, interaction id, appearance word, position and facing all
/// belong to the same actor, and taking only some of them would mix two servers'
/// data for one object.
