/// Supply and seasonal NPC dialogues: transcribed from the client's own
/// <c>NpcFun</c> scripts under the rules of
/// <c>docs/NPC对话链路技术文本.md</c> - numbers only from a script's own
/// <c>SubID</c> branch, one group per step, nothing sent for a branch whose label
/// the shipped client cannot draw, and no answer where wording alone is the basis.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Each <c>OpeningMenu</c> here lists only numbers whose label resolves to Chinese in
/// the client text table. Where a script's page-one header, or a later page, has no
/// text in either locale, that number is left out rather than drawn blank, and the
/// dialogue stops there until a capture settles the next step.
///
/// Four NPCs were examined and are deliberately not registered, each for a reason that
/// can be re-checked:
///
///   - <c>_131</c> Holy Stone Redeemer: <c>NpcFunHolyPackage.lua</c> draws no button at
///     all, and every one of its <c>HolyPackage1</c>-<c>HolyPackage10</c> keys, plus the
///     <c>NpcFunChains</c> keys that <c>NPC_FLAG_SYS_PINGZHEN = 92</c> reaches, is absent
///     from the client text tables. A result-only script has no menu to open.
///   - <c>_124</c> Event Awarder: <c>NPC_FLAG_ACTIVITY = 7</c> reaches the guild-quest
///     page (<c>NF_L0_97</c>-<c>NF_L0_99</c>) and <c>NPC_FLAG_SYS_DETAIL = 93</c> reaches
///     <c>NpcFunChains</c>, whose text is absent; neither wording matches "claim rewards
///     after the event has closed", so 2.12's binding test fails.
///   - <c>Sparta_025</c> Oriental Cuisine Master: no spawn record on any map, and the
///     Athens key of the same number is <c>[Warehouse]Kyriakou</c>, a different NPC. City
///     numbering cannot be assumed symmetric, so this is checked per <c>scene_key</c>.
///   - <c>_090</c> Pan's Envoy and <c>_133</c> B-Gold Trader: their scripts
///     (<c>NpcFunPan.lua</c>, <c>NpcFunMoney.lua</c>) contain no button branch at all -
///     every branch is an <c>EndMessage</c> result - so there is nothing to advertise.
