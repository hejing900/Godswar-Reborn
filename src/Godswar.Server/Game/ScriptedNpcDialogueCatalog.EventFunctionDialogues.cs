/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Six candidate NPCs were examined and rejected outright, which is a spec outcome
/// rather than unfinished work:
///
///   - <c>Sparta_141</c>/<c>Athens_141</c> Faction Changer,
///     <c>NpcFunMigration.lua</c> (<c>NPC_FLAG_SYS_MIGRATION = 112</c>): all nine
///     <c>Migration1</c>-<c>Migration9</c> keys are undefined anywhere in the shipped
///     <c>Localization/zh_cn</c> tree, so every branch calls <c>SetText(nil)</c> and
///     opens an empty window. <c>105</c> and <c>106</c> also share <c>25,135</c>.
///   - <c>Sparta_052</c>/<c>Athens_052</c> "[Exchange]Mentor" against
///     <c>NpcFunActivity.lua</c> (<c>NPC_FLAG_ACTIVITY = 7</c>): that script draws
///     <c>NF_L0_97</c>-<c>NF_L0_99</c>, which is the guild-quest page already used by
///     2.10 ("请选择发布给公会成员任务的种类"), not an item exchange. The 2.12
///     name-to-wording test fails, so the NPC keeps its current path.
///   - <c>Sparta_110</c>/<c>Athens_110</c> Pet Master is quest 303/1303's giver in
///     <c>StarterQuestChain</c>, so the quest gate in
///     <c>GameClientHandler.NpcDialogOpen.cs</c> owns it before any scripted dialogue
///     is consulted - the same exclusion as <c>_054</c>. Its
///     <c>NpcFunPetMaster.lua</c> keys <c>PL0001</c>-<c>PL0014</c> are also undefined
///     in <c>zh_cn</c>.
///   - <c>Sparta_090</c>/<c>Athens_090</c> Pan's Envoy, <c>NpcFunPan.lua</c>
///     (<c>NPC_FLAG_SYS_PAN = 10</c>): the script has no button and no
///     <c>SetPosition</c> at all - all four branches are <c>EndMessage</c> results,
///     so there is no menu to open, and any single reply closes the window. Choosing
///     which of them the original server sent is a wording read 3.5 forbids.
///   - <c>Sparta_128</c>/<c>Athens_128</c> Easter Envoy, <c>NpcFunRelive.lua</c>
///     (<c>NPC_FLAG_SYS_RELIVE = 51</c): all twenty-two <c>NF_L0_RL_*</c> keys are
///     absent from <c>zh_cn/UI/Base/LuaText.lua</c> and exist only in the
///     <c>en_us</c> copy, and two branches concatenate a nil, which raises a Lua
///     error. <c>902</c>-<c>907</c> are also drawn under both Index 2 and Index 3.
///   - <c>Sparta_133</c>/<c>Athens_133</c> B-Gold Trader, <c>NpcFunMoney.lua</c>
///     (<c>NPC_FLAG_SYS_MONEY = 100</c>) and <c>Sparta_119</c>/<c>Athens_119</c> IGG
///     Anniversary Envoy, <c>NpcFunIgg.lua</c> (<c>NPC_FLAG_SYS_IGG = 104</c>): the
///     first has no button at all and defines none of its four <c>MONEYCHANGE*</c>
///     keys in <c>zh_cn</c>; the second has exactly one button whose two keys
///     <c>igg100t</c>/<c>igg100b</c> are likewise undefined in <c>zh_cn</c>, and its
///     confirmation travels by message box, which has no packet here (2.7).
///
/// <c>NPC_FLAG_SYS_FIRE = 89</c> (<c>NpcFunFire.lua</c>, 燃放新春爆竹) was checked as
/// a possible home for "Spring Festival Envoy" and rejected: it has no button branch
